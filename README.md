### Best Practices

While this starter kit provides a decent foundation, adhering to certain best practices ensures maintainability and scalability:

* **Consistent Naming Conventions:** This helps in reading and understanding the purpose of a function or variable at a glance.

* **Modular Code:** Keep functions specific to their purpose and use components to build up larger sections of your application.

* **Regular Code Reviews:** Especially in collaborative environments, code reviews help maintain the quality of the codebase and foster learning.

* **Documentation:** As the project grows, proper inline documentation using tools like JSDoc can be invaluable.

* **Testing:** Remember to integrate tests into your workflow. This kit can be easily integrated with tools like `Jest` and `React Testing Library`.


### Extending & Customizing
The nature of this starter kit allows for easy extensions. Whether you want to integrate a backend, add a new library, or even switch out a tool, the modular structure and clear division make it easy.
